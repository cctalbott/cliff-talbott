      <p>Cliff grew up on a farm in Elk Point, South Dakota. He had a large family, as was common then. He spent much of his time fishing and hunting. He and a friend enlisted in the Army after hearing the news broadcast of the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.</p>
      <p>Cliff went into the 90th Infantry Division as a forward radio operator. His job was to scout the enemy and call in artillery. He entered the war landing on Utah Beach in the Normandy invasion. There were around 200 casualties in his landing group. This was a small amount compared to the around 2000 lost on Omaha Beach where the initial landing waves were effectively pinned down.</p>
      <p>After the Normandy landing his division met heavy resistance and casualties rose as they moved through the hedgerows of France.</p>
      <p>Cliff was on a hill overlooking a lake in Czechoslovakia 50 feet from the Russian Army when he heard the war had ended. From there he had occupation duty for a year in St. Lo, France, shipping around freight and surplus military equipment. After being discharged he spent some time back in South Dakota before heading back to Abilene, Texas, on January 7 of 1947 and taking work at a service station on 8th and Grape street. </p>

      <p>Cliff&rsquo;s parents were born around the 1880s. They bore 6 boys and 5 girls. People had a lot more kids back then, living a more agrarian lifestyles having the whole family working to provide for each other. Cliff and his family hunted and farmed for food and money. Cliff learned how to shoot killing ground squirrels with a .22 rifle. He was paid a quarter for each squirrel killed. .22 shells were 5 cents for a box of 50 at the time.</p>
      <p>Cliff met his wife Mozelle while stationed at Camp Barkeley in Abilene, Texas. They were married in 1943 before he shipped out to Europe. They spent the rest of their lives being a wonderful couple together.</p>
      <p>The only enjoyable part of the dirty business of going to war for Cliff was getting to see England. The most difficult part of the war for him and his division was the trudge through the Norman hedgerows. These hedgerows are mounds of earth and sunken roads overgrown with vegetation between fields at varying lengths and irregular angles. They were originally built to keep cattle in and mark boundaries. An offensive in them has been descriped as fighting in a maze. The Germans had pre&ndash;sighted machine guns and mortars in defensive positions to hit allied forces trying to move through.</p>
