      <p>Cliff grew up on a farm in Elk Point, South Dakota. He had a large family, as was common then. He spent much of his time fishing and hunting. He and a friend enlisted in the Army after hearing the news broadcast of the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941.</p>
      <p>Cliff went into the 90th Infantry Division as a forward radio operator. His job was to scout the enemy and call in artillery. He entered the war landing on Utah Beach in the Normandy invasion. There were around 200 casualties in his landing group. This was a small amount compared to the around 2000 lost on Omaha Beach where the initial landing waves were effectively pinned down.</p>
      <p>After the Normandy landing his division met heavy resistance and casualties rose as they moved through the hedgerows of France.</p>
      <p>Cliff was on a hill overlooking a lake in Czechoslovakia 50 feet from the Russian Army when he heard the war had ended. From there he had occupation duty for a year in St. Lo, France, shipping around freight and surplus military equipment. After being discharged he spent some time back in South Dakota before heading back to Abilene, Texas, on January 7 of 1947 and taking work at a service station on 8th and Grape street. </p>
